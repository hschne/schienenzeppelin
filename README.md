## FAQ

#### Why not Suspenders/Jumpstart etc? 

I wanted something that fits the way I like to write my Rails app. There are many application templates, but this one is mine.

#### What's with the German gibberish name?

I'm so glad you asked. The [Schienenzeppelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schienenzeppelin) was an experimental railcar which was briefly in operation during the 1930s. It was pretty fast, and it ran on Rails. Get it? :zany_face:
